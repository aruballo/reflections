What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A git file is created. I am not sure why this file is needed; perhaps it holds
the commits inside of it. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area holds the changes you are going to commit, and not the actual files like the working directory and the repo. 
It decouples your changes from your actual repo and directory. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can only add the files I need to commit into the staging area before commiting them. That way I am in control of what gets committed.
