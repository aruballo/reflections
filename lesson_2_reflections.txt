What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A git file is created. I am not sure why this file is needed; perhaps it holds
the commits inside of it. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area holds the changes you are going to commit, and not the actual files like the working directory and the repo. 
It decouples your changes from your actual repo and directory. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can only add the files I need to commit into the staging area before commiting them. That way I am in control of what gets committed. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If you are experimenting with a new feature, you could do it in a seperate branch from the master. That way if a bug fix
is needed in the middle of your work you revert to the master branch and fix the bug, and then checkout your modified branch
and continue working on your feature without any problems. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Easy way to visualize parents and paths. 

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

It combines all the commits from each branch into one single branch. 

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Not sure.
